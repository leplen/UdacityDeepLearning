1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,400
When you divide the scores
by 10 the probabilities

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,988
become very close to the uniform.

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:09,580
One-third, one-third, one-third.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,360
When you divide the scores by
10 the second answer is correct.
